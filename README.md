# Website-Project-Fall-2021
Term project for Fundamentals of Web Design class with Stephen Monk. October 2021. NBCC Saint John.
Group project with two other classmates. Our directive was to create a website with at least 3 different categories, and 8 different sub-categories. We chose music for our overall idea for the project and settled on three genres we would delve deeper into; Rock, Punk Rock and Hip Hop. We were to have a different design theme for each of our genres and the same header, nav bar and footer across every page. We were also required to make a logo and feedback page. I designed our logo and created the feedback page, my genre was punk rock so I created all those related pages. My classmate made the header/nav bar and footer.

We also had to follow certain guidelines and not use various styling elements that we hadn't learned about in class yet. No javascript, basic CSS, etc.
